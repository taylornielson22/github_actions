# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is called "build"
  build:
    # Github creates a ubuntu image to download repo, compile, package.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Tasks that will be executed as part of the job "build"
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Echo GitHub Actions Secret
        run: |
          echo PASSWORD token is: 
          echo ${{secrets.PASSWORD}}
        
      # Runs multiple commands
      - name: Python Version
        run: |
          echo What is the python version,
